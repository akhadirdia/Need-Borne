Application Description:
This web application is a platform for determining the number of charging stations to be installed to meet the growing demand for electrical infrastructure in a given region.

Key Features:
Parameter Selection:
Region: Users can select a region (e.g., Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue).
Client Type: The platform allows specifying the type of client (e.g., buildings, businesses, municipalities, etc.).
Number of Parking Spaces: An interactive slider lets users define the number of parking spaces planned for the installation.

Calculation of Charging Station Requirements:
The application generates a detailed table showing:
The number of charging stations to be installed each year based on different power levels (7.2 kW, 24 kW, 50 kW).
A projection of needs over several years (2023 to 2035).
Data is organized by year, providing long-term visibility for necessary infrastructure.

Data Visualization:

Dynamic Graphs:
The first graph displays the estimated percentage of electric vehicles in the selected region over a given period.
The second graph shows the projected number of electric vehicles, allowing users to assess demand growth.
These graphs use colored bars (green) for a quick and clear interpretation of projections.

Data and Methodology Download:
Users can download:
The data used for calculations.
